That doesn't mean you have to be a Linux expert to use the system! However the more you can get comfortable with the Linux command line and a handful of basic commands, the easier using the system will be. If you are already familiar with Linux, feel free to skip this section, or skim as a refresher.</p> <p>Most Linux commands deal with directories and files. A directory, synonymous to a folder, contains files and other directories. The list of directories that lead to a particular directory or file is called its path. In Linux, directories on a path are separated by forward slashes <code>/</code>. It is also important to note that everything in Linux is case sensitive, so a file <code>myScript.sh</code> is not the same as the file <code>myscript.sh</code>. When you first log in you are in you home directory. Your home directory is where you can put all the code and data you need to run your job. Your home directory is not accessible to other users, if you need a space to share files with other users, let us know and we can make a shared group directory for you.</p> EngagingSatoriSuperCloudOpenMind <p>The path to your home directory on Satori is <code>/home/&lt;USERNAME&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;USERNAME&gt;</code> is your username. The character <code>~</code> is also shorthand for your home directory in any Linux commands.</p> <p>The path to your home directory on Satori is <code>/home/&lt;USERNAME&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;USERNAME&gt;</code> is your username.

The character <code>~</code> is also shorthand for your home directory in any Linux commands.</p> <p>Anytime after you start typing a Linux command you can press the \"Tab\" button your your keyboard. This called tab-complete, and will try to autocomplete what you are typing. This is particularly helpful when typing out long directory paths and file names. Pressing \"Tab\" once will complete if there is a single completion, pressing it twice will list all potential completions. It is a bit difficult to explain in text, but you can try it out yourself and watch the short demonstration here.</p> <p>Finally, click on the box below for a list of Linux Commands.

Not requesting the resources you will be using can negatively impact others on the system.</p> <p>Please see your system's documentation pages for more information on requesting more resources for running interactive jobs, and how to run batch jobs.</p> EngagingSatoriSuperCloudOpenMind <p>The Engaging documentation on running jobs is available under the \"Running Jobs\" section on this site (see the sidebar on the left).

For example, request two nodes with 16 physical cores per node and all of the memory like this, <pre><code>#SBATCH -N 2\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=16\n#SBATCH --mem=0\n</code></pre></p> <p>As MPI is a distributed-memory parallelism, sometimes it is good to use the <code>--mem-per-core</code> flag assigning a certain amount of memory to each core. The total memory is increased with the number of cores in this case. Double check that the total memory fits in the maximum memory of a node to avoid failed jobs.</p> <p>Second, what is the speedup of your MPI program? According to Amdahl's law, well-performing MPI programs are usually speeded up almost linearly as the number of cores is increased until it is saturated at some point. In practice, try to run testing cases investigating the speedup of your program, and then decide how many cores are needed to speed it up efficiently. Do not increase the number of cores when speedup is poor. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>After a job starts to run, execute the command <code>squeue -u $USER</code> to check which node the job is running on, and then log in to the node with <code>ssh &lt;hostname&gt;</code> and execute the <code>top</code> command to check how many CPU cores are being used by the program and what the CPU efficiency is.

The follwing is a job script that runs a program with 2 MPI tasks and 8 threads per task on a node with 16 cores. <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH -p sched_mit_hill\n#SBATCH -t 30\n#SBATCH -N 1\n#SBATCH -n 2\n#SBATCH -c 8\n#SBATCH --mem=10GB\n\nmodule load gcc/6.2.0 openmpi/3.0.4\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\nmpirun -n $SLURM_NTASKS my_program\n</code></pre> The <code>-c</code> flag is the same as <code>--cpus-per-task</code>. The specified value is saved in the variable <code>SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK</code>. In this case, the total number of cores equals <code>SLURM_NTASKS * SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK</code>, that is 16. </p> <p>The built-in environment variable <code>OMP_NUM_THREADS</code> is used to set the number of threads for an OpenMP program. Here it is equal to <code>SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK</code>. The number of MPI tasks is set to be <code>SLURM_NTASK</code> in the <code>mpirun</code> command line, therefore, the nubmer of MPI tasks times the number of threads equals the total number of CPU cores. </p> <p>Users only need to specify the numbers following Slurm flags <code>-n</code> and <code>-c</code>, for example, <code>-n 4 -c 4</code> or <code>-n 8 -c 2</code>, keeping the product unchanged, then the MPI tasks and threads are all set automatically.  </p> <p>Similarly, here is an exmple script to request two nodes,  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH -p sched_mit_hill\n#SBATCH -t 30\n#SBATCH -N 2\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2\n#SBATCH -c 8\n#SBATCH --mem=0\n\nmodule load gcc/6.2.0 openmpi/3.0.4\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK\nmpirun -n $SLURM_NTASKS my_program\n</code></pre> In this case, the total number of cores is equal to <code>SLURM_NNODES * SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE * SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK</code>, that is <code>2 * 2 * 8 = 32</code>. The job will run 4 MPI tasks (i.e. 2 tasks per node) and 8 threads per task. Equation (1) is satisfied as <code>4 * 8 = 32</code>. </p> <p>As mentioned in the previous section, it is recommended to run testing cases to determine the values for the flags <code>-N</code>, <code>-n</code> and <code>-c</code> to obtain a better performance.</p> <p>There is another way to submit jobs for hybrid programs, in which the <code>-c</code> flag is not used at all. For example, it also works like this, <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH -p sched_mit_hill\n#SBATCH -t 30\n#SBATCH -N 1\n#SBATCH -n 16\n#SBATCH --mem=10GB\n\nmodule load gcc/6.2.0 openmpi/3.0.4\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=8\nMPI_NTASKS=$((SLURM_NTASK / $OMP_NUM_THREADS))\nmpirun -n $MPI_NTASKS my_program\n</code></pre> This job requests 16 CPU cores on 1 node and runs 2 MPI tasks with 8 threads per task, so equation (1) is satisfied as <code>2 * 8 = 16</code>. In this case, users need to set the values for the Slurm flag <code>-n</code> and the variable <code>OMP_NUM_THREADS</code>.</p>","tags":["Engaging","MPI","Howto Recipes"]},{"location":"recipes/mpi4py/","title":"MPI for Python","text":"<p>MPI for Python (<code>mpi4py</code>) provides Python bindings for the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard, allowing Python applications to exploit multiple processors on workstations, clusters and supercomputers.</p> <p>You can learn about <code>mpi4py</code> here: https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.</p>","tags":["OpenMind","MPI","Python","Howto Recipes"]},{"location":"recipes/mpi4py/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"OpenMindEngaging <p>The support team has installed <code>mpi4py</code> in an Anaconda module.

If you are only editing files this might be okay, although it is not encouraged. Beyond editing files please use a compute node for VSCode, as described on this page.</li> <li>Add the specific directories you need to your workspace. VSCode constantly scans all the files files and runs git commands on any local git repositories in your workspace, and it does this recursively. For this reason adding high-level directories to your workspace can slow things down quite a bit. For example, avoid adding your entire home directory or group storage to your VSCode session workspace.</li> <li>If you are having trouble authenticating, particularly if you are prompted for a password or 2 Factor authentication options, you can set <code>\"remote.SSH.showLoginTerminal\": true</code> in your settings.json file. See this page for more information.</li> <li>If VSCode is slow to start up on an ORCD System, check to see whether you are activating a conda environment at login.

We tend to refer to these types of jobs as throughput jobs.</p> <p>Job Arrays allow you to submit many sub-jobs and parameterize the inputs of these jobs. On this page we will refer to these sub-jobs as job array tasks, or tasks for short.</p> <p>When you run a job array the scheduler will set up two environment variables for each sub-job, or task, in the array:</p> <ul> <li><code>SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID</code></li> <li><code>SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT</code></li> </ul> <p>The first is a unique ID assigned to each task. The second is the total number of tasks. With these two numbers you have the information you need to run your tasks concurrently.</p> <p>The best way to run a Job Array is so that each job array task can be assigned a range of work to do. For example, if have 1000 simulations to run each with their own input file, you want to write your code so that each job array task is assigned multiple input files. If you have 4 tasks each would be assigned 250, if you have 8 tasks they'd each be assigned 125 input files, and so on.

It is important that the text in a Makefile should be as simple and clear as possbile. In this section, we will learn more useful features of GNU Make and write a real-world Makrefile at the end.</p> <p>In our previous examples, you may have noticed that there are many duplications of the same file name or command name. It is convinient to use varialbes in this case. Again, take our multi-file program for example. The Makefile can be rewitten as follows, <pre><code>CC=gcc\nOBJ=main.o WriteMyString.o\nEXE=write\n\n$(EXE): $(OBJ)\n        $(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(EXE)\n\nmain.o: main.c header.h\n        $(CC) -c main.c\n\nWriteMyString.o: WriteMyString.c\n        $(CC) -c WriteMyString.c\n\nclean:\n        rm $(EXE) *.o\n</code></pre></p> <p>Here we have defined the varialbes <code>CC</code> for the compiler, <code>OBJ</code> for object files, and <code>EXE</code> for the executable file. If we want to change the compiler or the file names, we only modify the corresponding variable at one place. </p> <p>If there are many varialbes to be defined, it is better to write the definition of all variables in another file, and then include the file in Makefile: <pre><code>include ./variables \n</code></pre> The file variables reads the following: <pre><code>CC=gcc\nOBJ=main.o WriteMyString.o\nEXE=write\n</code></pre></p> <p>Furthermore, we can upgrade the Makefile to a higher automatic level using the so-called automatic variables: <pre><code>$(EXE): $(OBJ)\n        $(CC) $^ -o $@\n\nmain.o: main.c header.h\n        $(CC) -c $&lt;\n\nWriteMyString.o: WriteMyString.c\n        $(CC) -c $&lt; \n</code></pre></p> <p>Here we have used these automatic variables:</p> <ul> <li><code>$@</code>  -- the name of the current target</li> <li><code>$^</code>  -- the names of all the prerequisites</li> <li><code>$&lt;</code>  -- the name of the first prerequisite</li> </ul> <p>These variables automatically take the names of current target or prerequisites, no matter what values are assigned to them.</p> <p>We then notice that the main.o and WriteMyString.o targets are built by the same command. Is there a way to combine these two duplicated commands into one so as to compile all source code files by only one command line? The answer is yes. It can be done with an implicit pattern rule: <pre><code>%.o: %.c\n        $(CC) -c $&lt;\n\nmain.o: header.h \n</code></pre></p> <p>Here the <code>%</code> stands for the same thing in the prerequisites as it does in the target. Usually, any object file with a subfix <code>.o</code> has a corresponding source file with a subfix <code>.c</code> as an implied prerequisite, so we can use the <code>%</code> to represent the name for both files. If a target (e.g. main.o) needs additional prerequisites (e.g. header.h), write an actionless rule with those prerequisites. We can imagine that applying this impilict rule should significantly simpify a Makefile when there are a large number of source files.</p> <p>Mostly the target name is a file name. But there are exceptions, such as the clean target in this example. The <code>rm</code> command will not create any file named <code>clean</code>. What if there exists a file named clean in this directory? Let's do an experiment. <pre><code>$ touch clean\n$ make clean\nmake: `clean' is up to date.\n</code></pre></p> <p>We can see that the clean target does not work properly. Since it has no prerequisite, the target clean will be considered up-to-date, and thus nothing will be done. To solve this issue, we can declare the target to be phony by making it a prerequisite of the special target <code>.PHONY</code> as follows: <pre><code>.PHONY: clean\n</code></pre></p> <p>A phony target is one that is not really the name of a file; rather it is just a name for a recipe to be executed.</p> <p>In summary, we write a real-world Makefile like so: <pre><code>include ./variables\n.PHONY: clean\n\n$(EXE): $(OBJ)\n        $(CC) $^ -o $@\n\n%.o: %.c\n        $(CC) -c $&lt;\n\nmain.o: header.h\n\nclean:\n        rm $(EXE) *.o\n</code></pre></p>","tags":["Software","C/C++","Engaging","OpenMind"]},{"location":"software/julia/","title":"Julia","text":"<p>Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language designed for technical and numerical computing, known for its speed and ease of use.
