Filesystems and File Transfer
=============================

ORCD clusters have central filesystems that are accessible form all compute nodes. These filesystems
provide general shared space that is openly available to everyone and project spaces that are configured for
use by specific groups. The different filesystems, how to transfer data between them and helpful practices
for using the filesystems effectively are described below.
