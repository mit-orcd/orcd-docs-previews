Basic software and package installation
=======================================

ORCD clusters have a set of pre-installed application and library software. This software collection tries
to cover many common needs. It is not unusual, however, for specific projects to need custom software. In
many cases this software can be installed by anybody. These pages cover standard software that is available
and describe some common ways to build software for yourself and/or for your group as needed.
