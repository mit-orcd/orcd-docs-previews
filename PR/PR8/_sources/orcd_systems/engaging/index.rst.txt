Engaging Cluster
================

The engaging cluster is a mixed CPU and GPU computng cluster that is openly available to all 
research projects at MIT. It has around 80,000 x86 CPU cores and 300 
GPU cards ranging from K80 generation to recent Voltas. Hardware access is through the Slurm 
resource scheduler that supports batch and interactive workloads and allows dedicated reservations.
The cluster has a large shared file system for working datasets. Additional compute and storage 
resources can be purchased by PIs. A wide range of standard software is available and the Docker 
compatible Singularity container tool is supported. User-level tools like Anaconda for Python, 
R libraries and Julia packages are all supported. A range of PI group maintained custom software 
stacks are also available through the widely adopted environment modules toolkit. A standard, 
open-source, web-based portal supporting Jupyter notebooks, R studio, Mathematica and X graphics 
is available at https://engaging-ood.mit.edu. Further information and support is available from 
engaging-support@techsquare.com.
