Scheduler Overview
==================

The Slurm scheduler is a tool that manages the allocation of 
computations to nodes of a cluster. Slurm is the fundamental tool
that controls work on the ORCD clusters. It can be used 
to run programs interactively or to execute work in a batch mode 
automatically. When using Slurm, a command or control script is
is used to request specific quantities of computer resources (nodes, CPU cores, memory,
GPUs etc...) that are required for some computation.
